# Store zone mapping for grouped shopping lists
# Format: zone1: pattern1, pattern2, pattern3
# Case-insensitive partial matching
# First matching zone wins
# Items are sorted by zone order (as listed below), then alphabetically within each zone
# Unmatched items go to "unzoned" at the end

# Example zone configuration - customize to match your store's layout
# Zone numbers/names can be anything: zone1, zone2, A, B, Front, Back, etc.
